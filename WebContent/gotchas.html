					<h2>No system is perfect, but we're close I think!</h2>

					<h3>Too much good stuff!</h3>
					<p>If you've got a great big garden or a food
						forest, you'll have plenty of places you can use your
						compost and liquid feed. My garden is 8m x 50m, about
						the size of an allotment. And I sell quite a few small
						trees in pots, which contain nothing but our own
						homemade compost. But sometimes, I end up with more
						liquid feed than I can use. Compost I can always find
						a good use for. But the liquid?</p>

					<p>Generally, vegetables don't need feeding in
						autumn or winter, and it's best to stop feeding trees
						by mid-summer so they can stop producing new wood and
						get down to ripening the wood in good time for winter.</p>

					<p>Here are three options for dealing with it:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Store it in a barrel or other container until
							the spring. It won't smell. It's quite stable.</li>
						<li>Use it to soak coarse sawdust, and when the
							sawdust is soaked through, use that as a mulch around
							trees and shrubs.</li>
						<li>Stop producing it. Stop adding urine to the
							compost. Send it down the usual channels for the
							water company to deal with.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Mould</h3>
					<p>I'm very sensitive to mould spores - I get
						allergic rhinitis, so if I get a lung full of mould
						spores, I'm wrecked for the day, with a streaming
						nose, eyes, and headache.</p>
					<p>The compost I produce is thick with mould
						spores. Commercial compost too has mould spores in it,
						which is why if you read the small print on the bag,
						it advises you to wear a mask when using it. My
						oversensitive nose has never reacted to commercial
						compost, so I conclude the homemade stuff has far more
						spores in it.</p>


						<div class="image-container left-image-container">
						<img src="../images/compostStore.jpg"
							alt="Emptied bin." class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">My compost store in the greenhouse. As yes, that is a microwave in the background.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Some of my compost I shovel through a small door
						in the side of my greenhouse into a bay where I store
						it for use when potting.</p>
						<div class="clear"></div>

					<p>I find that if I wear a mask - the N95 type that
						people use to protect themselves from COVID and other
						airborne bugs - I can use the compost in the
						greenhouse without triggering the rhinitis. I can also
						use the compost outdoors, without a mask, without a
						problem.</p>
					<p>If you are not prone to allergic rhinitis, this
						doesn't mean you can ignore all those spores. The
						spores are the same as farmers breathe in when they're
						hay-making (old-fashioned hay-making with small bales)
						and end up with 'Farmer's lung', which is like COPD,
						and I think incurable.</p>
					<p>So, to be on the safe side, use a mask if you're
						handling the compost in a greenhouse or potting shed.</p>

					<h3>Sawdust and other material</h3>
					<p>There's a joinery workshop near me, so it's easy
						to get all the sawdust I need. They leave it outside
						their workshop in big clear plastic bags. I don't take
						the fine stuff. I usually take the coarsest material.
						The fine stuff can clump together and spoil the
						airflow through the heap. The coarser stuff will
						become finer eventually, but it helps with the flow of
						air through the heap.</p>

					<p>
						At times, as when I'm at our food forest, I don't have
						sawdust available. There, I harvest bracken and use
						that. I don't bother chopping it up - I just use it
						whole. Again, like the coarse sawdust, the structure
						helps with the airflow. It will end up small all by
						itself, eventually looking just like peat with a few
						thicker stalks still visible (which I just ignore).
						Bracken is particularly good to use as it is high in
						potassium. I recommend reading <a
							href="https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/1998/01/fcin003.pdf" target="blank">this
							document</a> if you're going to use bracken, and take
						note of the advice on avoiding handling bracken in
						late August when it is full of cancer-inducing spores.
						In that document, I noticed the line: "Macronutrients,
						including P, K, Cl, and Na, were lost through leachate
						drainage declining to about half their initial
						concentration after three months of composting,
						although large amounts of water-soluble K still
						remained at the end of nine months composting (Pitman,
						1995)."
					</p>

					<p>I think I know the solution to the loss of the
						macronutrients (I think they meant micro-nutrients,
						but the solution is the same).</p>

					<h3>Rat-Tailed Maggots</h3>
					<div class="image-container left-image-container">
						<img src="../images/ratTailedMaggots.jpg"
							alt="Rat tailed maggots." class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">Rat tailed maggots.</div>
					</div>
					<p>One day, while draining my liquid to feed the
						plants, I saw these weird things stuck to the side.</p>
					<p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
						Turns out, they're called rat-tailed maggots, which
						sounds pretty disgusting. But they're the larvae of <em>Eristalis
							tenax</em>, the common drone fly. Which is a hoverfly that
						looks a lot like a bee. And like bees, they're great
						pollinators!
					</p>

					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="../images/droneFly.jpg"
							alt="Drone fly." class="right-image">
						<div class="image-label">Drone fly.</div>
					</div>

					<p>So another benefit of collecting the liquid from
						the heap - you breed your own pollinators!</p>
