					<p>This was my first attempt at building a
						rat-proof compost heap. I admit, it’s not pretty,
						though the ivy growing up it will help that a lot. But
						it works very nicely. I get great compost, no rats,
						and lots of potent liquid plant food.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<p>I think the IBC tank design is better – quicker,
						easier to make and just as effective, and it doesn’t
						have the high carbon cost of concrete. But this
						concrete setup should last forever, or close enough.
						And my garden is enclosed and only accessible through
						ordinary-sized doors. I wouldn’t have been able to get
						an IBC tank (or two) down here.</p>

					<p>One downside of the concrete design is that the
						roof and doors might be tricky to design to last. I
						used plywood, as I had it to hand, and I also had a
						big pot of epoxy paint left over from a boat building
						job. I imagined that paint would be really tough and
						stand up to the conditions – sun, rain, and frost on
						the outside, heat, and high humidity on the inside.
						It’s lasted a few years, but I’ll need to replace the
						woodwork soon. I’ve just been given some cement boards
						– boards used as backer boards for tiling wet areas
						like showers. They should last a long time without
						maintenance, but they seem a little brittle. We'll see
						how that works out.</p>

					<p>But anyway, the design captures the principles –
						no access for rats, the compost held above the floor
						allowing air underneath, and a system for collecting
						all the liquid that drips from the heaps. It’s also
						dark in there, so any germinating weed seeds soon die
						out and since the base of the heap is so well
						ventilated, air can pass right through the heap.
						There’s no need to turn it. The roof keeps the rain
						out – there’s no need to add water to the heap as it
						collects a little puddle of liquid underneath which
						has the incoming air passing over it. So it just stays
						damp, and no rain means no nutrients washed through.
						Just dump your weeds, vegetable scraps, and whatever
						else in there and leave it till it’s done.</p>



					<p>I designed two bins, side by side, so when one’s
						full, I just leave it and start filling the other.
						Filling a bin takes me a few months. In the meantime,
						the heap in the first bin is decomposing. By the time
						the second bin is full, it’s time to open the first
						bin and empty it. It might go onto raised beds for the
						vegetables, around fruit trees and bushes, or I might
						shovel it through a hole I built in the side of my
						greenhouse, to be stored there and used for potting.</p>

						<img src="../images/concrete/finishedCompost.jpg"
							alt="Finished compost." class="right-image">
						<div class="image-label">Finished compost.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Here's a bin ready for emptying. It was full to
						the brim when I closed the lid. It shrinks down to 1/2
						to 1/3 of the volume. But nothing is lost. The heap
						has lost structure and collapsed in on itself, and all
						the liquid that is a result of the decomposition is
						collected.

					<p>Here's the bin emptied. You can just make out
						the sheet of mesh laid on top of the pallet.
					<div class="clear"></div>
					<h3>So to build it:</h3>
					<p>You need:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Aggregate for making concrete.</li>
						<li>Sand for making mortar.</li>
						<li>Bags of cement.</li>
						<li>Blocks.</li>
						<li>Plywood, cement board, or aluminum sheeting
							to make the front hatches and roof.</li>
						<li>Two plastic pallets.</li>
						<li>Some stainless steel mesh to lay on top of
							the pallets.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="content ">
						<img src="../images/concrete/bins.png"
							alt="Emptied bin." class="full-width-image">
						<div class="image-label">A drawing of the bins.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Get hold of the pallets first. They come in
						different sizes, and you need to know the size so that
						you can build the walls fairly close around them.</p>

					<p>Build a concrete base, 100mm deep. Put a slight
						slope in the base so that the liquid drains to the end
						where you’re going to install the drain pipe. The base
						needs to be big enough so that your block walls aren’t
						sitting right on the edge of the base. Allow, say,
						200mm of freestanding concrete outside of the walls.
						Embed a 50mm piece of drain pipe in the wet concrete.
						I also built the bed big enough so there was room to
						work in front of the bins, to get a wheelbarrow in
						place to help with the emptying.</p>

					<p>When the concrete has set, put your pallets on
						top and draw around them with chalk. Leave a 30 - 50mm
						gap around the pallets, or they’ll be awkward to lift
						in and out. Leave enough space between the pallets for
						the central wall.</p>

					<p>Then do your blockwork. Leave a gap at the
						bottom corners of the central wall so that liquid can
						drain easily through it between the chambers.</p>

					<p>The roof area is bigger than you need when
						you’re filling in the bin. You only need to take the
						whole roof off when you’re emptying it. So I split the
						roof into two sections and put slopes on the back and
						front by creating wedges of cement on the tops of the
						blockwork. I made a simple mould and used it for all
						three wedges.</p>

						<div class="image-container left-image-container">
						<img src="../images/concrete/airBrick.png"
							alt="An air brick." class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">An air brick.</div>
					</div>

					<p>At the front of the blockwork, place one air
						brick by each bay and fill the rest of the space with
						plain bricks. This will allow enough air to get in
						under the pallet. The air will naturally flow upwards
						through the warm heap – flowing faster the hotter the
						heap gets and the more open the heap is. Don’t worry
						about how the air will escape from the top. Even if
						there’s just a millimeter gap between your roof sheets
						and the blockwork, taking into consideration the
						length of the edge to the roof, you’ll have as much
						room for the air to flow through as you have at the
						bottom through the air brick.</p>

					<p>The plywood I used to make the front and the
						roof I stiffened by gluing and screwing on some 50 x
						25mm roofing batten. I arranged the battens so no
						rainwater could puddle on the roof.</p>

					<p>The fronts slide up and down on the inside of
						the blockwork. To keep the woodwork in place I used
						brackets something like this – something I just had to
						hand.</p>
