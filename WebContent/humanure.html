						The best book I’ve read on composting is <a
							href="http://humanurehandbook.com/" target="_blank"><em>The
								Humanure Handbook - A Guide to Composting Human
								Manure</em> by Joseph Jenkins</a>. It’s an essential read for
						anyone interested in gardening, composting, or
						sustainable living. Jenkins masterfully addresses the
						potential concerns of composting human waste, making
						the case for its value in an entertaining and
						authoritative way. Backed by research and practical
						experience, his book challenges composting myths and
						presents a simple, effective approach to turning human
						waste into valuable compost.
					</p>

					<p>Inspired by Jenkins’ approach, I decided to try
						a compost toilet when faced with the challenge of
						installing a toilet in a small shower room. Instead of
						dealing with the hassle of traditional plumbing, I
						opted for a compost toilet. It was a simple solution:
						a bucket, sawdust, and some basic ventilation. This
						setup has served us well for 15 years, turning 'waste'
						into valuable compost for our garden.</p>

					<div class="content ">

						<div class="image-label">Our compost toilet

							years, but you get the idea.</div>
					</div>

					<p>I’d never considered composting our own sewage.
						Why bother? It’s not something most people think
						about. We use the toilet, pull the handle or push the
						button, and it’s gone. Out of sight, out of mind. Only
						in our case, in South Devon, it goes to a badly
						maintained sewage works with broken filters (I know
						the man commissioned to replace them) and a system
						that allows sewage into the rivers when the sewage
						works can’t cope with it, like, when it rains. So out
						of sight, out of mind, till you go for a walk by the
						river.</p>

					<p>Dealing with your own sewage seems an absurd
						proposition though when for most of us, the instant
						disposal solution is available. The first thing that
						struck me when I considered trying it was the strange
						irony of going to do all the work I’d need to do to
						have our poop taken away, when I was in the habit
						every year of collecting farm yard manure – taking a
						trailer to the farm, loading the trailer with a fork,
						driving home with my pile, unloading it into a
						wheelbarrow and taking it down the steep hill which is
						my garden. I was sending my own manure away, with the
						installation work involved and the ongoing costs for
						water to flush it and then doing all that work to
						collect animal manure. We ARE animals!</p>

					<p>So now I’ve been using a compost toilet for 15
						years. The work I have to do at home is collect a
						large sack of coarse sawdust from a nearby joinery
						workshop. A sack will keep us going for 2-3 months. We
						do our business on a little commode covering a bucket.
						Business done, we put a little shovel of damp sawdust
						on it. There’s no more smell than with a flushing
						toilet, and that is soon dealt with by the automatic
						fan with a timer. When the bucket is full, I empty it
						onto the compost heap. In summer, I cover that with
						weeds. In winter, I might add another thin layer of
						sawdust. If it’s really cold, it doesn’t matter.</p>

					<p>When the compost bin is full, I start filling a
						new one and leave the first to sit, the material
						decomposing. After a few months, I shovel the finished
						compost onto raised beds, amongst the fruit trees and
						bushes, or into an enclosure in one of my greenhouses
						for use in potting plants. I have a sideline in
						selling fruit and nut trees that I propagate, and this
						is the only compost I use for the pots. The trees grow
						well, and people are pleased with their purchases. It
						amuses me that really, they’re buying my poop,
						sawdust, and weeds with added tree seeds or cuttings.
						After a year or two, those ingredients turn into nice
						little trees!</p>

					<p>
						Anyway, I won’t make the case for composting your
						toilet matter here. If you’re really interested, just
						buy the <em>Humanure</em> book (I’m not on
						commission). Mr. Jenkins makes the case. I have a
						degree in microbiology. You’d think I’d know the ins
						and outs of it all, but Mr. Jenkins had a lot to teach
						me.
					</p>

					<p>
						But there are two issues I have with the guidance in
						the <em>Humanure</em> book. The first is the way that
						the compost heap just sits on the ground – all that
						precious nitrogen and other nutrients seeping away
						into the soil and eventually making it to the
						groundwater where it does no good at all. This point
						is addressed in the designs of the concrete and the
						IBC tank designs.
					</p>

					<p>The other point is that humanure is presented as
						all or nothing. I am currently building an off-grid
						house with a good-sized garden. A compost toilet
						(bucket/sawdust) dumped into an IBC composting bin is
						ideal for the situation. But the vast majority of
						people have the usual flushing toilets. Removing them
						to make way for a compost toilet would be a lot of
						work and probably devalue your house. And there are
						times, perhaps when you are ill, you can’t be bothered
						with the work of collecting sawdust and emptying
						buckets of poop. But there is a useful compromise
						which doesn’t necessitate a compost toilet.</p>

					<h2>A Practical Compromise</h2>

					<p>Most of the plant food that comes from the
						humanure bucket is actually contained in the urine.
						70-90% of the nitrogen excreted by the human body is
						excreted in the urine. Your poop has more phosphorus
						than your urine, but only by volume, and the
						phosphorus in the poop is in a less soluble form than
						that found in urine. It’s a similar situation with
						potassium too. So while the poop has some valuable
						nutrients for plants, it has little that isn’t also in
						urine. But the main thing growing plants need is
						nitrogen, and the great majority of that is in urine.</p>

					<p>
						So without going to the trouble of building a compost
						toilet, you can get most of the benefit of a compost
						toilet simply by adding urine to your compost. Urine
						is considered a compost ‘accelerator,’ which means
						even if your heap is just a pile of plants on the
						ground, pouring urine onto the heap will add nitrogen
						and the rest to the heap, which is what your bacteria
						need to get the composting process really going. But
						look at the <a href="chemistry.html">chemistry</a>
						page and see what happens to urine when it is poured
						onto a compost heap.
					</p>

					<p>A compost heap is teeming with bacteria. Plants
						are just covered in them. You don’t have to add any.
						All you have to do is provide the right conditions and
						the bacteria multiply very quickly indeed (some
						bacteria can double every 20 minutes!). The right
						conditions are a mix of high carbon material (e.g.,
						dead vegetation, sawdust) and high nitrogen material
						(e.g., fresh grass cuttings, coffee grounds, urine),
						moisture, and air. Very many of those bacteria have an
						enzyme called urease, which breaks down the urea in
						urine and begins its transformation into more stable
						and less smelly nitrate.</p>

					<p>So when you pour urine onto a heap, the heap
						gets all the moisture it needs (it needs to drain out
						the bottom to prevent it from becoming water-logged,
						which can turn the heap anaerobic and smelly), it gets
						all the nitrogen it needs (some is adsorbed into the
						compost material, making the compost contain more
						immediately available plant nutrients) and the liquid
						you can collect from the bottom of the heap is high in
						nitrates, and contains some potassium, phosphorus, and
						small quantities of other minerals.</p>

					<p>Rather than switching to having a compost
						toilet, you can get most of the benefit and less of
						the work simply by putting a bucket in your garage or
						shed and peeing into that and emptying it into your
						compost bin daily.</p>

					<div class="image-container left-image-container">
						<img src="../images/boatToilet.jpg" alt="Emptied bin."

						<div class="image-label">Removing the old toilet
							storage tank from behind the bulkhead allowed me to
							fit the 'compost' toilet in that space, removing the
							orginal toiler. This freed up a lot of space on the
							boat.</div>
					</div>



					<p>I’d recommend rinsing and scrubbing the bucket
						daily though. We used to have a <a
							href="http://sagittacatamaran.blogspot.com/search/label/dessicating%20toilet/" target="_blank">‘compost’ toilet on a
						boat</a>, and collected the urine using a separating seat.
						The urine went down a pipe into a 5-litre bottle which
						was emptied daily. No matter how much I rinsed those
						bottles, they’d build up a layer of stuff on the
						inside which was impossible to remove and started to
						smell. Rinsing wasn’t enough, even with sea-water. We
						just had to start a new bottle every week.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<p>So, I’d recommend a compost toilet along the
						lines Mr. Jenkins recommends – just using a bucket and
						collecting all the urine and poop and adding a
						covering of sawdust after each use – if you want an
						off-grid system, or you want to maximize what you add
						to your compost heap, or you don’t want to send your
						sewage down the river. But most of the benefits of
						having a compost toilet can be won simply by adding
						your urine to the heap.</p>
