Structure
Introduction and Flow:

Start with a clear introduction that outlines what the reader can expect. For instance, begin with a brief overview of composting and its significance in gardening.
Organize the content into clear sections with headings. For example:
Introduction to Composting
The Process of Decay
Role of Microbes in Composting
Soil Composition and the Importance of Organic Matter
Practical Benefits of Compost in Gardening
Logical Flow:

Ensure each section logically leads to the next. For instance, after discussing the decay process, segue into the role of microbes, then move on to how this affects soil structure and plant nutrition.
Personal Experience:

Integrate personal experiences more smoothly into the discussion. Perhaps set aside a specific section for your observations and conclusions based on your gardening experience.
Accuracy
Compost Definition:

Compost isn’t just “dead and decaying plant material.” It often includes other organic matter, such as food scraps and sometimes animal manure, which are all broken down by microbes.
Plant Material Breakdown:

Clarify the roles of different microbes. For example, mention that bacteria primarily break down simpler organic compounds, while fungi handle more complex substances like lignin.
Soil Composition:

The description of soil composition is generally accurate, but it might help to clarify that these percentages can vary widely depending on soil type.
Impact on Fertility:

The relationship between compost and soil fertility could be explored more deeply. Consider explaining why increased organic matter doesn’t always result in dramatically increased plant growth, such as the need for a balanced nutrient profile or possible limitations due to other factors like pH or soil texture.
Clarity
Technical Terms:

Some terms (e.g., "lignin," "cellulose") might be unfamiliar to all readers. Consider briefly defining them when first introduced.
Simplify Complex Sentences:

Some sentences are quite long and complex, which can make them harder to follow. For example:
Original: "The process of decay happens quickly with fresh plant material piled up, as the cells walls collapse releasing the more easily digestible material."
Revised: "Decay happens quickly when fresh plant material is piled up. As the cell walls collapse, they release easily digestible materials."
Use of Pronouns:

Be careful with pronoun use to ensure clarity. For instance, when you say, “These are the materials a living plant needs to absorb to grow,” specify that "these" refers to water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, sulfur-based materials, and minerals.
Additional Suggestions
Concluding Thoughts:

Add a concluding paragraph that summarizes the key points and perhaps offers a final takeaway or a call to action for gardeners.
Visual Aids:

If this is intended for a web or print publication, consider adding diagrams or illustrations to help visualize the composting process, soil composition, and the changes you've observed in your garden.
Connecting Personal Observations:

Tie your personal gardening experience more explicitly to the scientific processes you describe. For example, you could explain how the improvements in soil structure directly relate to the microbial activity discussed earlier.
Revised Excerpt
Here’s how a revised section might look:

Introduction to Composting

Compost is more than just dead plant material; it’s a dynamic mixture of decaying organic matter that fuels the life cycle of plants. Understanding how compost breaks down and benefits your garden is key to creating healthy, productive soil.

The Process of Decay

When plants die, their complex structures, made of carbohydrates like cellulose and lignin, proteins, and sugars, begin to break down. Bacteria quickly consume the sugars and proteins, using them as an energy source. Certain bacteria specialize in breaking down cellulose, while only specific fungi can digest lignin, a tough compound that can take years to decompose.

Role of Microbes in Composting

Decay happens rapidly when fresh plant material is piled up, as cell walls collapse and release nutrients. During this phase, compost heaps can generate heat as bacteria multiply, especially those that thrive at higher temperatures. Once the easily digestible materials are exhausted, the heap cools, and the slower process of breaking down tougher materials like lignin begins.

Soil Composition and the Importance of Organic Matter

Soil is composed of mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air. Although organic matter makes up only about 5% of soil, it’s crucial for creating a complex structure that allows for proper air and water flow, supporting plant life. This organic matter is in a constant state of decay, releasing nutrients that plants need to grow.

Practical Benefits of Compost in Gardening

Adding compost to your garden soil improves its structure, making it lighter and spongier. When I started working on my garden, the soil was dense clay. After years of adding compost, it’s now much looser and easier to work with, even during dry spells. However, while I noticed an improvement in soil structure, the increase in fertility was not as dramatic as I had expected.
