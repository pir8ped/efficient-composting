Your text is concise and informative, but there are areas where its structure, clarity, and accuracy can be improved. Below is a critique of the text with suggestions for enhancement.

Structure
Introduction:

Start with a brief overview that introduces the problem with traditional composting systems and hints at the solution your system offers.
Consider organizing the text into sections with clear headings, such as:
Challenges with Traditional Compost Systems
Benefits of the New System
How the System Works
Why This System is Superior
Logical Flow:

The current text jumps quickly from problems to solutions without fully developing each idea. Start by clearly outlining the limitations of conventional composting methods before introducing your system as the solution.
Ensure each point builds on the previous one, leading naturally to your system's advantages.
Conclusion:

Add a concluding sentence or paragraph that summarizes the benefits of your system and invites readers to learn more.
Accuracy
Nutrient Loss in Traditional Composting:

The claim that "most compost systems lose a lot of plant nutrients into the soil they are sitting on" might be too general. While nutrient leaching can occur, it depends on the composting method and setup. Consider specifying which types of systems are prone to this issue.
Rat Infestation:

The statement that "rats are likely to make a home there" might need more context. Rats are attracted to certain types of compost, particularly if food waste is included, but this isn't an issue for all compost systems. Clarify under what conditions this is more likely to occur.
Hot Composting:

The requirement to turn hot compost regularly is accurate, but it might help to briefly explain why this is necessary (e.g., to maintain oxygen levels and even heating).
Clarity
Simplify Complex Ideas:

The sentence, "The system I am describing produces excellent compost, a liquid plant food that has dramatic effects on plant growth, is inaccessible to rats, doesn’t need turning, and doesn’t become smelly," contains multiple ideas that could be broken down for clarity.
Consider separating the benefits into individual sentences or a bulleted list.
Specify the System:

When you refer to "the system I am describing," the reader may need more context. Briefly describe what the system entails before diving into its benefits.
Optional Features:

The mention of composting "everything your own body produces" may benefit from a more tactful phrasing, especially if this is not a requirement. You could introduce this as an option for those who are interested in full-cycle composting.
Additional Suggestions
Engage the Reader:

Pose a question or a provocative statement at the beginning to engage the reader. For example, "Are you tired of losing valuable nutrients and dealing with smelly, rat-infested compost heaps?"
Visual Aids:

If this is part of a larger publication or website, consider including diagrams or images of the compost system to help readers visualize the process.
Call to Action:

Encourage readers to explore your system further, either by providing links to detailed instructions or by offering a next step, such as trying out a simple design.
Revised Excerpt
Here’s a potential revision of the text:

Challenges with Traditional Compost Systems

Traditional composting systems, while effective at producing soil amendments, often lose valuable plant nutrients into the ground. This leaching can reduce the compost's effectiveness as a source of plant food. Additionally, these systems can attract unwanted pests like rats, especially when food waste is involved. Hot composting methods require regular turning to ensure that all materials are evenly decomposed and to prevent anaerobic conditions that cause unpleasant odours.

A Better Solution

The composting system I am introducing overcomes these common challenges. It produces not only rich compost but also a potent liquid plant food that significantly enhances plant growth. This system is designed to be rat-proof, requires no turning, and remains odour-free throughout the process.

How It Works

The key to this system's success is in elevating the compost heap off the ground and allowing urine to pass through the heap, collecting nutrient-rich liquid at the bottom. This method ensures that nothing is wasted or lost into the soil. It can handle all types of organic waste, including kitchen scraps, garden trimmings, and even, if you choose, human waste.

Why This System is Superior

By capturing and utilizing every part of the composting process, this method provides a more complete and efficient way to recycle organic materials. The compost it produces improves soil structure, while the liquid plant food boosts fertility, leading to healthier, more vigorous plant growth.
