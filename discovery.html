					<h2>The Challenge of Traditional Composting</h2>
					<p>I’ve been composting for years, using the
						resulting compost on my vegetable beds and around my
						fruit trees. Over time, my soil, once hard clay that
						baked in the summer sun, has become more structured
						and friable, teeming with worms and other beneficial
						creatures. The soil is now much easier to work.
						Despite these improvements, my crops were often
						disappointing. Even with the addition of rotted
						manure, "greedy feeders" like cauliflowers and
						Brussels sprouts struggled to thrive.</p>

					<h2>The Humanure Experiment</h2>
					<p>
						For the last ten years at least, I’ve been
						supplementing my compost with humanure – a mix of our
						toilet waste and sawdust (see the <a
							href="http://humanurehandbook.com/">humanure
							guide</a> for details). While this added some fertility,
						my crops still weren’t prize-winning, and the effort
						seemed disproportionate to the results.
					</p>

					<h2>The Nutrient Loss Problem</h2>
					<p>I’d planted a walnut tree downhill from my
						compost heaps, hoping it would benefit from any
						nutrients that leached into the soil from my compost.
						The tree grew like a weed. One day, as I was standing
						at the top of the garden looking down the hill, I was
						astonished to see the top third of the walnut tree
						snap off, move slightly to one side, and fall to the
						ground. It was not a windy day – there was barely a
						breeze!</p>
					<p>I’ve since learned that it’s easy to over-feed a
						tree. If you do, it will grow rapidly, but the wood it
						produces is weak and sappy. It is prone to producing
						too much sap, which makes it a target for greenfly,
						scale, and other pests. The wood is soft and weak, and
						as I saw with my own eyes, very prone to breaking.</p>
					<p>That gave me a clue as to how much nutrient was
						lost from the bottom of my compost heaps.</p>

					<h2>Commercial Compost</h2>
					<p>Commercial composts often include tiny blue or
						green plastic balls. These aren’t contaminants;
						they’re deliberately added slow-release fertilisers
						encased in plastic. While effective, these plastic
						particles remain in the soil long after the compost
						has broken down.</p>
					<p>Is it possible to make homemade compost that’s
						as fertile as these commercially fortified options,
						without the plastic? Absolutely – and with even
						greater fertility if desired.</p>

					<h2>Solving my Rat Problem Solved Everything Else</h2>
					<p>One persistent issue was the rats that found a
						home in my compost heaps. No matter how many I trapped
						or how vigilant the local cats were, the heaps
						provided them with food, warmth, and shelter. Whether
						I added cooked scraps or only raw materials, the rats
						thrived.</p>
					<p>The solution to the rat problem led me to solve
						my fertility issues as well.</p>
					<p>I built compost bins on a concrete base with
						masonry walls. This kept out the rats and allowed for
						better control of the composting process. I put a
						plastic pallet in each bin and covered it with
						stainless steel mesh. This was initially to allow
						drainage so that the heap couldn't become waterlogged.
						But I realized this also allowed me to ventilate under
						the heap, allowing plenty of air to pass through. I
						used an airbrick in the bottom row of bricks to allow
						the airflow. Then, of course, the bins needed
						draining, so I made the concrete beds have a slight
						slope and installed a pipe to collect the liquid that
						drains from the heap.</p>

					<h2>The Result</h2>
					<p>Zero rats. And this system produces rich, evenly decayed
						compost without the need for turning. The liquid that
						drains from the heap is an amber-coloured fertiliser
						far superior to the usual 'nettle tea.' With two bins
						in rotation, I always have a supply of 'black gold'
						compost and nutritious liquid feed, providing all the
						fertility my garden needs.</p>

					<h2>The Liquid - Almost Magic!</h2>
					<p>Even though I suspected a lot of fertility was
						being lost into the ground, I wasn't prepared for how
						useful the liquid turned out to be.</p>
					<p>I experimented with diluting it and feeding a
						few plants. I was careful to note which plants I'd fed
						and which I hadn't. I was hoping to see a difference
						within a few weeks. However, the morning after I'd fed
						the plants, I couldn't believe my eyes! Tomato plants
						were thicker in the stem, with a darker green leaf
						colour, and were pushing out new shoots. Wherever I'd
						used the liquid, there were already signs of deeper
						colouring, new shoots, and leaves.</p>
					<p>But I was delighted when I tried the liquid on
						some young trees in my forest garden. I'd planted
						peaches, nectarines, and apricots that I'd grown from
						seed. The trees that weren't damaged by voles, deer,
						frost, or drought were slow growing, and I was losing
						hope I'd ever get any fruit for my efforts. But these
						were the trees that responded most powerfully to the
						liquid feed. Like the tomatoes, I saw immediate
						results – well, overnight anyway. But they just didn't
						stop growing. I fed them every 10-14 days, and they
						grew like crazy. In 12 weeks, trees that were just two
						feet high (though 3-4 years old) grew to six feet
						high!</p>

					<p>Look - my first nectarines. The tree had grown
						from only 2 feet high to 6 feet high that summer! And
						the following Spring...</p>

					<p>And here, my first apricot on a tree grown from

						produced nothing before.</p>

						<img src="images/stonePine.jpg" alt="Stone Pine"

						<div class="image-label">Stone Pine.</div>
					</div>
					<p>And this tree in my food forest attempt, growing
						out from its protective cage, is a stone pine – the
						kind of pine that eventually produces pine nuts.
						Again, from two feet high to this, over 4 feet high, in 12 weeks.</p>

						<img src="images/apricotAndMould.jpg"
							alt="Apricot - and sooty mould." class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">Apricot - and sooty
							mould.</div>
					</div>
					<p>But look again at the photo of the apricot. See
						the leaves are black in places? That's sooty mould.
						It's unsightly but doesn’t harm the tree. It's just
						mould that feeds on the liquid that comes from the
						leaves. Here, the liquid is too rich in sugar, and so
						the mould thrives. The tree is growing too fast. You
						can't see it in the photo, but there are also scale
						insects on the branches, also feeding off the too-rich
						sap.</p>

					<p>I’ve learned since my early experiments that
						commercial apricot growers feed their trees enough to
						make them grow 2 feet a year. That's enough. They'll
						be healthy like that. Their wood won't grow weak and
						sappy, they won't be too prone to insect attack and
						mould.</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
					<p>But now I know what it takes to make these trees
						and vegetables grow. And I'm learning how much liquid
						to use. Trees I feed little by little throughout
						spring and early summer, making them grow well but not
						too much. Then I leave them alone during late summer
						and autumn so that the growth slows down and the wood
						hardens. Vegetables I feed more intensively,
						especially cabbages, cauliflowers, squashes, and
						tomatoes, and I feed them until late summer.</p>

					<p>All I was doing was trying to solve the rat
						problem but clearly, I've found out why my compost
						wasn't providing enough nutrients for my plants, and I
						have the solution at my finger tips.</p>
