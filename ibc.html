					<h1>A design using an IBC tank</h1>
				</header>
				<main>
					<p>
						An IBC tank makes a quick and easy compost bin. It’s
						over a cubic metre, so it has the capacity to build up
						some heat when it’s filled. It has a tap at the
						bottom, and a shallow channel, making collecting the
						liquid that drips from the heap easy. It needs some
						air holes drilling in near the bottom (<span
							class="important">not right at the bottom or
							in the bottom, or you’ll lose all your liquid!</span>). And
						it’s easy to cut off the top and make it into a lid.
						I’ll show you how.
					</p>

					</div>


					<p>This is a quicker and easier option than the
						concrete compost bins, but I didn’t think of it first.
						However, I've since realised that since my garden is
						so enclosed, there was no way I was going to get an
						IBC tank into it. So, if you have the choice I’d
						recommend the IBC tank design. The concrete design is
						fine for when you can’t get an IBC tank on site.</p>

					<p>I use a black tank. A white/transparent tank
						will look ugly and the light that gets in will be
						enough to allow some weeds to grow. Metal tanks are
						available too. I haven’t tried one, but a metal one
						won’t maintain the heat in the compost so well, and a
						bit of heat speeds up the composting process, kills
						many pathogens and kills many seeds. So use a black
						tank if you can. You can buy them quite cheaply second
						hand, but make sure they have only been used for
						storing water, or vegetable oil or something innocuous
						like that. A tank that has contained chemicals or
						diesel is no use, as it will contaminate your compost.</p>

					<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>IBC tank (preferably black)</li>

						<li>Polyester cord (3-4mm)</li>
						<li>Plastic pallet</li>
						<li>Non-woven ground cloth or expanded mesh
							(stainless steel recommended)</li>
						<li>Bucket or separate tank/barrel for liquid
							collection</li>
					</ul>



					<h2>Tools Needed</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Spanners</li>
						<li>Jigsaw</li>
						<li>Drill with 3-4mm and 8-10mm drill bits</li>
						<li>Hacksaw or grinder</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Steps to Make a Tank</h2>

					<p>So, here’s how to make a tank. In short, we’re
						going to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Remove the plastic tank from the cage</li>
						<li>Cut the top off and make it into a lid</li>
						<li>Attach the lid with string (stronger, easier
							and more accurate than you'd think!)</li>
						<li>Alter the cage so that it holds the open lid
							at a nice angle</li>
						<li>Put the tank back in the cage</li>
						<li>Add a cut down plastic pallet for drainage</li>
					</ul>

					<p>An hour’s work if you have tools to hand.</p>

					<h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>

					<p>I made my first IBC compost bin and took
						photographs as I did it, but I forgot to take a
						photograph before I started.</p>
					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/intactTank.jpg"
							alt="BC ready for adaptation.">
						<div class="image-label">IBC ready for
							adaptation.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Here’s a picture of the intact tank – except
						it’s not quite. I’d already started. See those two
						eyes on the top of the tank? They’ve normally got a
						couple of aluminium rods poking through that help give
						the structure some rigidity. Well, the first thing to
						do is remove those rods. You’ll need spanners to undo
						them.</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
					<p>With the top rods removed, you can now remove
						the tank from the cage. Tip it onto its side and slide
						the tank out.</p>

					<p>Next, mark a line around the sides maybe
						80-100mm from the top. This is the line you’ll cut
						along to take off the lid. But don’t cut it yet.</p>

					<div class="image-container left-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/holesforAHinge-50.jpg"
							alt="Hinge holes drilled.">
						<div class="image-label">Hinge holes drilled.</div>
					</div>

					<p>
						<strong>Before you cut the lid off, make some
							holes for the hinges.</strong> I made my hinges with 3-4mm
						polyester cord. It’s cheap, strong and will last as
						long as the tank.
					</p>

					<p>On the rear of the tank, first drill two
						parallel series of holes as in the photograph, one
						series for each side. Make the holes on each row
						vertical, one above the other. That way, we can thread
						through the string and the lid will stay in line with
						the tank when you open the lid, and close back down
						neatly. If the hinge is messy, the lid won’t close
						evenly and you’ll let out the heat from the heap and
						allow rodents in.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<p>While you’ve got the drill handy, make some more
						holes 100mm from the bottom of the tank, to allow air
						in. I say around, as it depends on the depth of your
						plastic pallet. You want the holes to be just below
						the top of the plastic pallet. That keeps a reservoir
						at the bottom of the tank for retaining liquid and
						allows air into the bottom of the heap. If you make
						the holes too high, they’ll become blocked with
						compost. Too low, you lose some capacity of the
						reservoir. You need bigger holes than for the hinges.
						Use an 8-10mm drill bit.</p>

						<img src="images/ibc/cuttingTheTopOff.jpg"
							alt="Cutting the top off.">
						<div class="image-label">Cutting the top off.</div>
					</div>


					<p>Once you’ve made all the holes, cut along the
						lid line with a jigsaw.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/topremoved.jpg"
							alt="Top removed.">
						<div class="image-label">Top removed.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Next, lay the lid close to the tank, and thread
						the hinges as shown.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<div class="clear"></div>
					<div class="image-container left-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/hingeFromOutside.jpg"

						<div class="image-label">The string hinge from
							the outside.</div>
					</div>


					<div class="image-container right-image-container">

						<div class="image-label">The string hinge from

					<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="images/ibc/cuttingTheCage.jpg"
							alt="cutting the cage" class="right-image">
						<div class="image-label">Cutting the cage.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Now we need to tweak the cage so that there’s
						room to open the lid, but if we do it carefully, we
						can make the cage support the lid when it’s open,
						which is handy. At the back of the cage, at the top,
						cut through the top rail with a hacksaw or grinder. I
						used a hacksaw, and it didn’t take long.</p>


					<div class="clear"></div>


					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/bendingTheTopOfTheCage.jpg"
							alt="cutting the cage" class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">Cutting the cage.</div>
					</div>

					Next, lay the cage down on its front and use a beam to
					bend the top part of the cage. Bend a bit, the same
					each side, just a bit so that it will support the open
					lid.
					</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>


					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/tankWithLidBackInCage2.jpg"
							alt="Checking the lid support of the cage."
							class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">Checking the lid
							support of the cage.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Then put the tank back in the cage. Check the
						lid support works. You might need to remove the tank
						to adjust the cage a little.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/palletInstalled.jpg"
							alt="Cut down pallet installed." class="right-image">
						<div class="image-label">Cut down pallet
							installed.</div>
					</div>

					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/drainHoleFromInside.jpg"
							alt="Inside the bottom of the tank."
							class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">Inside the bottom of
							the tank.</div>
					</div>

					<p>Nearly there. Now we need to cut down the
						plastic pallet to fit into the bottom. A jigsaw is the
						ideal tool for this. Preserve as much pallet as you
						can, shaping it to a close fit to the side of the tank
						and around the drain hole. I put a sheet of paper in
						the bottom, cut that to shape and then used that as a
						template to cut the pallet.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<div class="image-container right-image-container">
						<img src="images/ibc/mesh.jpg" alt="Mesh."
							class="left-image">
						<div class="image-label">Stainless steel mesh.</div>
					</div>


					<p>The pallet will support the compost up off the
						floor, but the holes in the pallet are too coarse –
						compost will fall through the pallet and clog the
						system up. You need to lay something on top of the
						pallet to prevent compost from falling through, but
						allow air through to the bottom of the heap. I used
						some non-woven ground cloth – the stuff that is used
						under driveways and tracks to prevent clay mixing with
						the hard core on top. I used that because that was
						what I had to hand. Better is expanded mesh.
						Galvanised might last a couple of years, but the
						environment is pretty corrosive for metals, so I’d
						recommend paying a bit more and buying some stainless
						steel mesh. It will outlast you.</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>

					<p>Now you just need to make an arrangement to
						collect the liquid. If your garden is on a hill, you
						could use a separate tank or barrel to collect the
						liquid. It’s easy to fit a hose to the tap with a hose
						adapter. For the time being, I just dug a bucket-sized
						hole in the ground near the tank and led a hose to
						that. I keep a stick propped up in the bucket,
						otherwise I find dead mice or lizards floating in it.
						A stick propped up allows creatures to climb out after
						they’ve fallen in.</p>

					<p>To empty the compost once it’s done, do it the
						hard way, climbing in the top and forking it out, or
						tip the tank on its side, and fork it out. A tractor,
						some levers, or some help might be good for getting
						the tank onto its side. I have a tractor with a
						front-end loader, so it’s easy to tip the tank, untie
						the hinges to remove the lid, then tip the tank upside
						down and lift it off the heap.</p>
