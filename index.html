					<h1>Summary</h1>
				</header>
				<main>
					<p>The system I describe here is efficient in that
						it requires minimal work, nothing is wasted, and it
						produces both excellent compost and a leachate that is
						rich in plant nutrients.</p>

					<p>Most compost systems lose a lot of plant
						nutrients into the soil they are sitting on. They
						produce compost, which is a very good soil amendment,
						but does not provide much in the way of plant food.</p>

					<p>The system I am describing produces excellent
						compost, a liquid plant food that has dramatic effects
						on plant growth, is inaccessible to rats, doesn’t need
						turning, and doesn’t become smelly.</p>

					<p>Nothing is wasted or lost into the soil. You can
						compost everything that has ever lived or is the
						product of something that has lived – all your weeds
						and trimmings, kitchen waste, and if you like,
						everything your own body produces (optional!).</p>

					<p>The system depends on raising the compost heap
						from the ground, passing urine through the heap, and
						collecting the liquid from the bottom. This site
						describes why the method is so beneficial and gives a
						couple of simple designs that make the process easy.</p>

					<p>It is particularly suitable for people with
						allotments, large gardens or forest gardens, or people
						who strongly object to providing a home for rats in a
						conventional compost heap.</p>
